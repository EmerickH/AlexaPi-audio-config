# Audio setup
## Choose an option here:

* ![R](rasp.png) [I'm using AlexaPi on a Raspberry PI](raspberry.md)
* ðŸ…° [I want to use Alsa](alsa.md)
* ðŸ‡µ [I want to use PulseAudio](pulse.md)

## What to choose?

 * **Alsa** is easyer to setup (recommended on simple applications) BUT âš 
 * **Pulseaudio** allows you to use multiple applications with audio at the same time (recommended on Desktop OS or if you have a music server for example on the same machine)
 * If **Alsa** is not working choose *PulseAudio*.
